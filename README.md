# Unreal Engine 4 VR Intro Starter Project READ ME

This project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com "Udacity - Be in demand")'s [Unreal Engine 4 VR Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com)

This project is your first chance to make a game within Unreal Engine 4 for either standing or room-scale VR. You’ll need to utilize motion controllers to build a kitchen-themed interaction game, and you’ll use functions, physics, blueprint communication, and audio to create an immersive experience. Spawn messy dishes and get them into the sink as quickly as possible!



## Necessary Software
- [Epic Games Launcher, Unreal Engine 4.14 or 4.15](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog)
- [SteamVR](http://store.steampowered.com/steamvr) OR [Oculus Home](https://www.oculus.com/setup/)

## New To Github?

Github is one of the best ways for software developers to store their code and easily make changes that are then tracked and easily shareable with your team of developers. If you would like to learn more about Github, Udacity offers [a free course on how to use Github](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775). For the puposes of the VR Nanodgree, you will simply need to download this project by:
1. Clicking **"Clone or download"**
2. Clicking **"Download ZIP"**

## Project Details
* Unreal version 4.15.3 used.
* Headset project was built with OculusRift in mind
* All 3rd party assets were either from Udacity or starter content

## Experience and Timer Design:
The player experience for this project is to "clean" as many dishes as you can. 

Press the big red button to start the game and restart the game. 

To score, keep holding a plate for 1 second inside the sink. Both left and right motion controllers work to grab plates.  Hearing a balloon pop means you scored 1 point. 

The player has 60 seconds to "clean" as many plates as possible.  Once timer ends, the game is over!  To Restart, simply push the big red button again.

More plates spawn after 30 seconds of gameplay.
